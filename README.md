# Doc to Json Converter

This is an application that converts .doc files to json format, which is more easy to use in web-applications.<br><br>
<b>For Example:</b>Consider the case of form filling,here insted of filling the form online,user can upload his details in form of a doc file which would be parsed and used to fill the details automatically.

<br>

#Usage

This is a very basic prototype, the user has to store the details in the file named 'hell.doc' , example.php parses the doc file and echoes the json generated by the form.

#Issues

->After parsing it to json,some extra characters are being added to the fields.<br>
->This is just a prototype,so all the css stuff will be done later.<br>
->Have to make a service so that user uploads the form and details get parsed without manually changing the files.<br>
